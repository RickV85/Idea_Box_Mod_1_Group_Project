# idea-Box

### `Abstract:`
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser.

### `Installation Instructions:`
1. [Click To Open Repo](https://github.com/KarrarQ/idea-Box)
2. Click the "Fork" button. (This will create a user copy of the repository.)
3. Open the Terminal application.
4. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate to where the local repository will live.
5. In GitHub, click on the green "Code" dropdown.
6. User will see three clone options. Select "SSH".
7. Copy the SSH key.
8. In Terminal, run "git clone [insert copied SSH key here]".
9. In Terminal, use the "cd" command to navigate into the newly created directory.
10. Open the local repository by typing:
    * Atom - atom .
    * VS Code - code .

### `Context:`
It took our team a few days (~4) to write the code for this project. We just completed our fourth week of Mod 1 at Turing School.

### `Learning Goals:`
1. Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp.
2. Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model.
3. Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed.
4. Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP.

### `Technology Used:`
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this application was written in VS Code and pushed into GitHub. 

### `Team Wins`
1. We were able to successfully add the ability to save/delete idea from local storage.
2. We were able to refactor JavaScript which allowed us to eliminate 50+ lines of repeated code. 
3. We were able to teach ourselves a variety of new methods through additional research.

### `Future Additions`
1. The primary future addition planned for the Idea Box website would be for the user to be able to comment on their ideas.
2. By favoriting an idea the user is able to in a sense already comment on their idea, but adding the ability to add additional text comments beyond whether they view the idea as a top idea or not would be beneficial.
3. It would of course be important that this functionality persists beyond a single browser session just like the ideas themselves do.
